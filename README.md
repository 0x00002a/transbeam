# transbeam

_a channels library for C++ inspired by crossbeam_

## Introduction

This is a C++ channels library inspired by the rust [crossbeam][crossbeam-repo] library. It is currently
quite barebones and I make no promises about its bugfree-ness

### Example usage

you can see some examples in the `examples` directory
